\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Include {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{Manager_8h_source}{Manager.\+h}}} into your source code;
\item For more convenience it can be mentioned that you are {\ttfamily using namespace \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceClassProject}{Class\+Project}};};
\item First of all create an instance of the {\ttfamily Manager} class that will hold the ROBDD you are building;
\item Then create variables contained in your boolean formula using {\ttfamily create\+Var} method (the first created variable will have the lowest id), {\bfseries{important}}\+: creating of variables is not allowed after performing any operations;
\item Use created variables in your boolean formula using methods performing boolean operations on BDD nodes\+:

{\ttfamily and2} {\ttfamily or2} {\ttfamily xor2} {\ttfamily nand2} {\ttfamily nor2} {\ttfamily neg};
\item After operations being performed the created instance contains {\ttfamily unique\+Table} representing the ROBDD;
\item For analysis of the built ROBDD the following methods can be used\+:

{\ttfamily get\+Top\+Var\+Name} {\ttfamily find\+Nodes} {\ttfamily find\+Vars} {\ttfamily co\+Factor\+True} {\ttfamily co\+Factor\+False};
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
